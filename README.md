Finished [MSc](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/megm/descricao) degree at [IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) 
in [2009](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/downloadFile/395139480478/NaturalFractureNetworks.pdf) and immediately after 
(2010) joined [Cerena](http://cerena.ist.utl.pt/) research center. There conducted research and development in several 
fields of mathematics applied to geosciences and released open-source software such as [Fillworks](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fillworks/),
[ECMWF parser](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ecmwfparser/) and [GEOMS2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoms2/?source=directory).
In 2014 became Assistant Lecturer for two MSc level courses at [IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) and by 2016 joined [Geovariances](http://www.geovariances.com/en/) 
as Software Engineer. Independently it has developed several free [Educational Apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=6135518111922353974&hl=en) 
for Android and frequently releases online publications and software.

# Open-Source Software

[GEOMS2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoms2/) - A Geostatistics and Geosciences modeling software. Mostly written 
in [Python](https://www.python.org/) (some algorithms in C/C++), its fully equipped with a 3D viewer ([Mayavi](http://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/)), 
2D plots ([matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)) and several numerical features for estimation, simulation, data analysis,
and modeling. It was developed to replace software like the historical [Geoms](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoms/) and
[GSI Student Toolbox](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gsistb/) (only the latter developed by me). This project was made 
within [Cerena](http://cerena.ist.utl.pt/) research center as support to research and education. 

[ECMWF parser](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ecmwfparser/) - This software was developed to support the research and 
development conducted by [Cerena](http://cerena.ist.utl.pt/) research center in the [ESA](http://www.esa.int/ESA) project 
[Desertwatch](http://due.esrin.esa.int/page_project65.php). This project aimed to develop of an EO-based Information 
System to support national and regional authorities in reporting to the UNCCD and monitoring 
desertification trends over time. The software itself computed, visualized, and estimated (downscaling operations) 
important risk factors maps from the [ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int/) reanalysis data. Other smaller toolbox were built 
within the same project such as [ANA parser](https://sites.google.com/site/cmrpsoftware/anaparser).

[Fillworks](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fillworks/) - Fillworks was developed to support a consultancy project 
regarding the construction of a railway line in New Guinea. It provides visualization, drawing and calculation of 
fill and cut areas (to extrapolated volumes) given topography. This quantification of different railway scenarios 
provided a first measure of cost prior to further developments in construction. Latter it was used for 
 educational purposes.
 
[dAnalytics](https://sourceforge.net/projects/danalytics/) - Small tool built specifically for educational purposes 
in data analysis, specifically discriminant analysis, allowing the student to quickly make experiments in 
a GUI supported environment.
