Finished [MSc](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/megm/descricao) degree at [IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) 
in [2009](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/downloadFile/395139480478/NaturalFractureNetworks.pdf) and immediately after 
(2010) joined [Cerena](http://cerena.ist.utl.pt/) research center. There conducted research and development in several 
fields of mathematics applied to geosciences and released open-source software such as [Fillworks](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fillworks/),
[ECMWF parser](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ecmwfparser/) and [GEOMS2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoms2/?source=directory).
In 2014 became Assistant Lecturer for two MSc level courses at [IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) and by 2016 joined [Geovariances](http://www.geovariances.com/en/) 
as Software Engineer. Independently it has developed several free [Educational Apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=6135518111922353974&hl=en) 
for Android and frequently releases online publications and software.

# Commercial Software

[Isatis.neo](https://www.geovariances.com/en/software-geovariances/) - It developed tools for this and other software solutions in Geovariances. Isatis.neo and other Geovariances products use geostatistics to perform spatial estimation in several sectors related to spatial imaging, namely Oil & Gas, Mining, Environment, Hydrogeology, Contamination, etc.

[UncerTZ/Isatis.neo Petroleum](https://www.geovariances.com/en/news/uncertz-consortium-time-depth-conversion-evolved/) - As part of a research and development consortium a time to depth conversion software was developed, later added as the Oil & Gas oriented edition of Isatis.neo. This software uses geostatistics, among other techniques, to perform a series of operations regarding the fields of Geophysics and Reservoir Engineering. 

# Open-Source Software

[GEOMS2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoms2/) - A Geostatistics and Geosciences modeling software. Mostly written 
in [Python](https://www.python.org/) (some algorithms in C/C++), its fully equipped with a 3D viewer ([Mayavi](http://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/)), 
2D plots ([matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)) and several numerical features for estimation, simulation, data analysis,
and modeling. It was developed to replace software like the historical [Geoms](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoms/) and
[GSI Student Toolbox](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gsistb/) (only the latter developed by me). This project was made 
within [Cerena](http://cerena.ist.utl.pt/) research center as support to research and education. 

[ECMWF parser](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ecmwfparser/) - This software was developed to support the research and 
development conducted by [Cerena](http://cerena.ist.utl.pt/) research center in the [ESA](http://www.esa.int/ESA) project 
[Desertwatch](http://due.esrin.esa.int/page_project65.php). This project aimed to develop of an EO-based Information 
System to support national and regional authorities in reporting to the UNCCD and monitoring 
desertification trends over time. The software itself computed, visualized, and estimated (downscaling operations) 
important risk factors maps from the [ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int/) reanalysis data. Other smaller toolbox were built 
within the same project such as [ANA parser](https://sites.google.com/site/cmrpsoftware/anaparser).

[Fillworks](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fillworks/) - Fillworks was developed to support a consultancy project 
regarding the construction of a railway line in New Guinea. It provides visualization, drawing and calculation of 
fill and cut areas (to extrapolated volumes) given topography. This quantification of different railway scenarios 
provided a first measure of cost prior to further developments in construction. Latter it was used for 
 educational purposes.
 
[dAnalytics](https://sourceforge.net/projects/danalytics/) - Small tool built specifically for educational purposes 
in data analysis, specifically discriminant analysis, allowing the student to quickly make experiments in 
a GUI supported environment.

# White Papers

* [Learning Game: The Math Adventures of Oscar](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277776242_Learning_Game_The_Math_Adventures_of_Oscar) (2015) - The game was developed to train memory and mathematical reasoning of children in the ages of 5 to 9 and was largely adapted from the concept of casual gaming, typically a kind of game with a small amount of required commitment where the game-play is extremely intuitive and it has a “just to pass the time” state of mind. This article documents the development and the chosen method of commercialization for this game.
* [An introduction to "collective publishing"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262796853_An_introduction_to_collective_publishing) (2014) - Considering the current state of communication technology this article hopes to expose a new concept, henceforth called “collective publishing”, which allows users to create their own journals and magazines without the need for sophisticated and highly proficient teams and software.
* [Natural Fracture Networks](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/downloadFile/395139480478/NaturalFractureNetworks.pdf) (2009) - This is actually the extended abstract version of my thesis. It was reviewed by juri but it was never published in journal.

# Musical composition and Songwriting

* [A Procura (The Search)](https://soundcloud.com/pedro-correia-712367707/a-procura) - This was an early sketch of a music for a video game (a kind of point and click crime novel) that was never finished. This is the type of music made to be played in loop (thus the repetition). It was made to give a sense of investigation, mystery, a searching for answers.

* [WALF - Tema Principal (Main Theme)](https://soundcloud.com/pedro-correia-712367707/main-menu-theme) - This was an early sketch of a music for a video game (a kind of point and click crime novel) that was never finished. This particular track was made to be played in the main menu.

* [Sozinho na tua cor (Alone in your color)](https://soundcloud.com/pedro-correia-712367707/sozinho-na-tua-cor-myspace) - Songwriting in my university days, when social/ethical activism was a daily routine (released under the pseudonym Duarte Remna). It speaks about isolation, loneliness, indinference and prejudice.

* [Nova Terra (New Land)](https://soundcloud.com/pedro-correia-712367707/nova-terra-myspace) - Songwriting in my university days, when social/ethical activism was a daily routine  (released under the pseudonym Duarte Remna). It speaks about unfair treatment given to immigrants.
